Table 2-1. Recommended PHP configuration settings
Directive Local value Remarks
display_errors On Essential for debugging mistakes in your scripts. If
set to Off, errors result in a completely blank screen,
leaving you clueless as to the possible cause.
error_reporting 32767 This sets error reporting to the highest level.
file_uploads On Allows you to use PHP to upload files to a web site.
log_errors Off With display_errors set on, you don’t need to fill
your hard disk with an error log.

make sure the following extensions
are enabled:
• gd: Enables PHP to generate and modify images and fonts.
• mysqli: Connects to MySQL/MariaDB (note the “i,” which stands for “improved.”
PHP 7 doesn’t support the older mysql one, which should no longer be used).
