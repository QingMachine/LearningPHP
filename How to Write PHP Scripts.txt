Every PHP page must have the following:
• The correct filename extension, usually .php
• PHP tags surrounding each block of PHP code (the closing PHP tag is optional if the
file contains only PHP code)
A typical PHP page will use some or all of the following elements:
• Variables to act as placeholders for unknown or changing values
• Arrays to hold multiple values
• Conditional statements to make decisions
• Loops to perform repetitive tasks
• Functions or objects to perform preset tasks
